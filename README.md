# Kanban

Before executing this project, you must first launch the backend which can be found on this link : `https://github.com/TodiBG/SIR-TP5-API-Kanban`.
However, it may happen that at the first execution the data does not load directly, in this case you have to refresh the page and the data will be displayed.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
